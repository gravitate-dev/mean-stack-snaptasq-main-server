    <div class="row top-buffer">
        SnapTasq is an online software product that allows users to accomplish simple tasks with people they are closest to. Users request and monitor tasks to be done by a list of people they are already closest to. SnapTasq was founded when Robert Irribarren
        observing his friends at college needing small tasks completed when stuck studying. For the time being they were using a Facebook group to accomplish these task. To expand features beyond what the Facebook group was capable of providing, Robert
        decided to create an app focused on "friends helping friends".
